# Legacy Site Migration Summary

## Migration Completed: OCR J277 Error Spotter

### What Was Migrated

The legacy HTML site (`legacy/index.html`) has been successfully migrated to the modern React + TypeScript template.

### Key Features Retained

1. **Three-Input System**
   - Line number input (number field)
   - Error type selection (dropdown: syntax/logic)
   - Correction input (text field)

2. **Question Bank**
   - All 32 error-spotting questions migrated
   - Includes syntax and logic errors in OCR ERL code
   - Questions with line numbers, descriptions, and detailed answers

3. **Scoring System**
   - Partial credit system (0-3 points per question)
   - 1 point for correct line number
   - 1 point for correct error type
   - 1 point for correct correction
   - Tracks accuracy, streak, and total points

4. **Code Display**
   - Line-numbered code blocks
   - Properly formatted OCR ERL code
   - Visual highlighting similar to original

### Files Created

- `/src/routes/error-spotter.tsx` - New route for Error Spotter mode
- `/src/components/ErrorSpotterQuiz.tsx` - Specialized quiz component with 3 inputs

### Files Modified

- `/src/lib/questionData.ts` - Added ErrorSpotterQuestion interface and 32 questions
- `/src/lib/scoreManager.ts` - Added "Error Spotter" mode to score tracking
- `/src/routes/index.tsx` - Added Error Spotter to mode selection
- `/src/components/index.ts` - Exported ErrorSpotterQuiz component

### Files Marked as Old (Template Files)

- `/src/routes/old_datatypes.tsx` - Original Data Types template
- `/src/routes/old_constructs.tsx` - Original Constructs template
- `/src/routes/old_operators.tsx` - Original Operators template
- `/src/routes/old_champion.tsx` - Original Champion template

These files can be deleted after verification if not needed.

### Differences from Legacy Site

**Removed:**
- Practice/Test mode toggle (can be re-added if needed)
- Progress bar for test mode
- Final results screen

**Added:**
- Modern React component architecture
- TypeScript type safety
- Real-time stats tracking (points, streak, accuracy)
- Integration with existing score management system
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Better animations and transitions

### Testing Notes

To test the migration:
1. Ensure Node.js version is 20.19+ or 22.12+ (required by Vite)
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Navigate to "Error Spotter" mode from home page
4. Test all three inputs work correctly
5. Verify partial credit scoring (0-3 points)
6. Check feedback messages for line number, error type, and correction

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to fully replicate the legacy site:
1. Add Practice/Test mode toggle
2. Implement 10-question test mode with progress bar
3. Add final results screen for test mode
4. Consider adding timer or time tracking
5. Delete old_*.tsx files after verification

### Color Scheme Match

The component uses colors similar to the legacy site:
- Blue highlight for program description
- Gray code blocks with line numbers
- Green for correct answers
- Yellow for partial credit
- Red for incorrect answers
