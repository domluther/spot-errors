# ✅ Enter Key Double-Fire Fixed

## Issue Found
The Enter key was **submitting AND immediately moving to the next question** - causing the feedback to flash and disappear instantly.

## Root Cause
**Two event listeners firing simultaneously:**
1. Input's `onKeyDown` handler → Checked `showFeedback` and called `generateQuestion()`
2. Global window `keydown` listener → Also checked `showFeedback` and called `generateQuestion()`

Both were triggering because:
- Submit happens first, setting `showFeedback = true`
- Then the global listener sees `showFeedback = true` and immediately generates next question
- Result: Feedback appears for a split second then disappears

## Solution

### 1. Removed Global Window Listener ❌
Removed this problematic code:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleGlobalKeyPress = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === "Enter" && showFeedback) {
      e.preventDefault();
      generateQuestion();
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener("keydown", handleGlobalKeyPress);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleGlobalKeyPress);
}, [showFeedback, generateQuestion]);
```

### 2. Added Focused Feedback Section ✅
Made the feedback section focusable and gave it its own keyboard handler:

```tsx
<div
  ref={feedbackRef}
  tabIndex={0}  // Makes it focusable
  onKeyDown={(e) => {  // Local keyboard handler
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
      e.preventDefault();
      generateQuestion();
    }
  }}
  className="... outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500"
>
```

### 3. Auto-Focus Feedback When It Appears ✅
Added effect to automatically focus the feedback section:

```tsx
// Focus feedback section when it appears
useEffect(() => {
  if (showFeedback && feedbackRef.current) {
    feedbackRef.current.focus();
  }
}, [showFeedback]);
```

## How It Works Now

### Workflow:
1. **Fill inputs** → Line number, error type, correction
2. **Press Enter from any input** → Submits answer
3. **Feedback appears** → Automatically focused (blue ring shows focus)
4. **Press Enter on feedback** → Loads next question
5. **First input auto-focuses** → Ready to type again

### Why This Works:
- ✅ **Input handlers** only fire when inputs have focus
- ✅ **Feedback handler** only fires when feedback section has focus
- ✅ **No overlap** between the two contexts
- ✅ **Auto-focus** moves focus automatically after each step

## Visual Feedback
When feedback section has focus, you'll see:
- 🔵 **Blue ring** around the feedback box (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500`)
- 💡 **Hint text**: "Press Enter to continue"

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/src/components/ErrorSpotterQuiz.tsx`
  - Removed global window event listener
  - Added `feedbackRef` ref
  - Added `tabIndex={0}` to feedback div
  - Added `onKeyDown` handler to feedback div
  - Added `useEffect` to auto-focus feedback
  - Added focus ring styling

## Testing Results
- [x] ✅ Enter submits answer (doesn't skip to next question)
- [x] ✅ Feedback stays visible after submit
- [x] ✅ Enter on feedback advances to next question
- [x] ✅ No double-firing
- [x] ✅ Smooth focus management
- [x] ✅ No TypeScript errors

## User Experience
**Keyboard-First Workflow Now Works Perfectly:**
1. Type → Tab → Type → Tab → Type
2. Press **Enter** → See feedback
3. Read feedback (auto-focused)
4. Press **Enter** → Next question
5. First input auto-focused → Start typing immediately

**No mouse needed, no double-fires, no glitches!** ⌨️✨
